            <li>We may update and change our Site from time to time to reflect changes to our products, our users' needs and our business priorities.</li>
            <li>We do not guarantee that our Site, or any content on it, will always be available or be uninterrupted. We may suspend or withdraw or restrict the availability of all or any part of our site for business and operational reasons.</li>
            <li>You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access our Site through your internet connection are aware of these Conditions and other applicable terms and conditions, and that they comply with them.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>These Conditions refer to the following additional terms, which also apply to your use of our site</strong>:
            <ul>
            <li>Our <a href="{{ route('privacy') }}">Privacy Policy</a>, which includes information about the cookies on our site.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>How we may contact you</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>If we have to contact you we will do so by telephone or by writing to you at the email address provided to us in your order. "<strong>Writing</strong>" includes emails. When we use the words "<strong>writing</strong>" or "<strong>written</strong>" in these Conditions, this includes emails.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>You must keep your account details safe</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>If you choose, or you are provided with, a user identification code, password or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential. You must not disclose it to any third party.</li>
            <li>We have the right to disable any user identification code or password, whether chosen by you or allocated by us, at any time, if in our reasonable opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Conditions.</li>
            <li>If you know or suspect that anyone other than you knows your user identification code or password, you must promptly notify us.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Our contract with you and how we will accept your order</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>We will acknowledge your order by e-mail as soon as possible. Please note that this email does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Product. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an email confirming that the Product has been dispatched (the "<strong>Dispatch Confirmation</strong>"). The contract between us for the purchase of the Products will only be formed when we send the Dispatch Confirmation.</li>
            <li>If we are unable to accept your order, we will inform you of this in writing and will not charge you for the Product. This might be because the Product is out of stock, because of unexpected limits on our resources which we could not reasonably plan for, because we have identified an error in the price or description of the Product or because we are unable to meet a delivery deadline you have specified.</li>
            <li>If you wish to make a change to the product you have ordered please contact us. We will let you know if the change is possible. If it is possible we will let you know about any changes to the price of the product, the timing of supply or anything else which would be necessary as a result of your requested change and ask you to confirm whether you wish to go ahead with the change.</li>
            <li>It is your responsibility to check that your order is accurate and to give us all the information we need to complete the order. We will let you know what, if any, information we do need. We will not be responsible for supplying the Products late or not supplying any part of them if this is caused by you not giving us the information we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.</li>
            <li>The images of the Products on our Site are for illustrative purposes only. We try to ensure that the products represented on the Site are accurate, but please note we cannot guarantee that a device's display accurately reflects the colour, typeface or layout of the Products and that slight variations in colour, typeface and layout may occur between the Products as you see them on screen and those that are delivered.</li>
            <li>When using our Site, you accept that communication with us will be mainly electronic. For contractual purposes, you agree that all contracts, notices, information and other communications that we provide to you electronically comply with any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. This condition does not affect your statutory rights.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Price of the Products </strong>
            <ul>
            <li>The price of the Products and any delivery costs will be calculated, in pounds sterling, when you complete your order form and will be the price (including any VAT) as shown at the bottom of the order form, except in cases of obvious error.</li>
            <li>Local taxes and customs charges may be applicable and will be your responsibility. Please note that you must also comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the Products are destined. We will not be liable for any breach by you of any such laws.</li>
            <li>If we accept your order, the price will be as stated on the order form, although if the rate of VAT increases between the date of your order and the date of the Dispatch Confirmation, we will add the necessary additional amount of VAT to the price of the Products and this will be shown on the Dispatch Confirmation.</li>
            <li>Subject to our obligation to supply Products at the price stated in accepted orders, we reserve the right to change the list prices of the Products at any time.</li>
            <li>Our Site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on the Site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where the Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching a Product to you. If the Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on our Site, we will inform you as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you we will treat the order as cancelled. If you cancel the order and have already paid for the goods, you will receive a full refund.</li>
            <li>If we accept and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid and require the return of any goods provided to you.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Payment </strong>
            <ul>
            <li>When you place your order you must stipulate your chosen method of payment. The payment options are:
            <ul>
            <li>payment by credit/debit card at the time of order;</li>
            <li>payment by cheque or credit/debit card after the order is placed.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You must pay for the Products before we dispatch them. We will not charge your credit or debit card until we dispatch the Products to you. If you do not make payment by one of the above methods before we send you a Dispatch Confirmation and either the Products have not been delivered to you or you have ordered more Products from us, we may withhold any deliveries to you to the value of the outstanding sum until you have paid all sums owed to us.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Delivery </strong>
            <ul>
            <li>Subject to clause 7 above, the Products will be dispatched to you as follows:
            <ul>
            <li>All non-personalised greetings cards and other Products:
            <ul>
            <li>within three working days of your order, we will use our reasonable endeavours to confirm whether we can fulfil your order and if we can, we will provide you with a Dispatch Confirmation;</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Personalised Products:
            <ul>
            <li>within 10 working days following your approval of the proof (provided by us online or by email or by post) we will use our reasonable endeavours to confirm whether we can fulfil your order and if we can, we will provide you with a Dispatch Confirmation;</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>We aim to deliver all Products within the timeframes as set out in the Dispatch Confirmation, and where this is not possible, then within a reasonable time of the date of the Dispatch Confirmation, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</li>
            <li>We are not responsible for delays outside our control. If our supply of the Products is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end the contract and receive a refund for any Products you have paid for but not received.</li>
            <li>If no one is available at your address to take delivery and the Products cannot be posted through your letterbox, we will leave you a note informing you of how to rearrange delivery or collect the Products from a local depot.</li>
            <li>If you do not collect the Products from us as arranged or if, after a failed delivery to you, you do not re-arrange delivery or collect them from a delivery depot we will contact you for further instructions and may charge you for storage costs and any further delivery costs. If, despite our reasonable efforts, we are unable to contact you or re-arrange delivery or collection we may end the contract and clause 20 will apply.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ownership of the Products and when you become responsible for the Products</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>The Products shall remain our property and ownership of the Products shall not pass to you until we have received payment in full.</li>
            <li>The Products will be at your risk from the time we deliver the Product to the address you gave us or you (or a carrier organised by you) collect it from us.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Our Responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>We warrant that the Products which we supply to you will be as described, of satisfactory quality and reasonably fit for all of the purposes for which products of the kind are commonly supplied.</li>
            <li>We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. If we fail to comply with these Conditions, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sales process.</li>
            <li>We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the Products including the right to receive products which are: as described and match information we provided to you and any sample or model seen or examined by you; of satisfactory quality; fit for any particular purpose made known to us; supplied with reasonable skill and care and for defective products under the Consumer Protection Act 1987.</li>
            <li>Our liability for losses you suffer as a result of us breaking this agreement is strictly limited to the purchase price of the Product you purchased.</li>
            <li>We are not liable for any business losses. We are not responsible for indirect losses which happen as a side effect of the main loss or damage, including but not limited to loss of income or revenue, loss of business, loss of profits or contracts, loss of anticipated savings, loss of data or waste of management or office time however arising and whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract or otherwise.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Defective Products </strong>
            <ul>
            <li>If, once you have examined the Products, you discover a defect in the quality of the Products you must tell us as soon as possible after discovering the defect.</li>
            <li>If you notify us of a defect in the quality of the Products you must return the Products to us. We will then examine the returned Products to confirm whether they are defective and if they are defective we will notify you via e-mail of the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case within 30 days of the day we confirmed to you via e-mail that you were entitled to a refund for the defective Products. Products returned by you because of a defect will be refunded in full, including a refund of the delivery charges for sending the item to you and the cost incurred by you in returning the item to us. Your statutory rights are not affected by anything in these Conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Your responsibility for providing information we may require</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>We may need certain information from you so that we can supply the products to you, for example, information to create any personalised Products. If so, this will have been stated in the description of the products on our website. We may contact you in writing to ask for this information. If you do not give us this information within a reasonable time of us asking for it, or if you give us incomplete or incorrect information, we may either end the contract (and clause 20 will apply) or make an additional charge of a reasonable sum to compensate us for any extra work that is required as a result. We will not be responsible for supplying the Products late or not supplying any part of them if this is caused by you not giving us the information we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.</li>
            <li>Should you wish to place orders with us over the telephone, and not through one of our websites, all the information you give will be used and relied upon for the preparation and dispatch of your order. It is your responsibility to check that all of the information given is correct, and we cannot be held responsible if such information is later found to be incorrect.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ending the contract because of something we have done or are going to do. </strong>
            <ul>
            <li>If you are ending a contract for a reason set out at 15.1.1 to 15.1.5 below the contract will end immediately and we will refund you in full for any Products which have not been provided and you may also be entitled to compensation. The reasons are:
            <ul>
            <li>we have told you about an upcoming change to the Product or these Conditions which you do not agree to;</li>
            <li>we have told you about an error in the price or description of the Product you have ordered and you do not wish to proceed;</li>
            <li>there is a risk that supply of the Products may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control;</li>
            <li>we have suspended supply of the Products for technical reasons, or notify you we are going to suspend them for technical reasons; or</li>
            <li>you have a legal right to end the contract because of something we have done wrong.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
