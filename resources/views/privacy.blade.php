          <ol>
            <li><strong>Who we are</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>This website is provided by The Greetings Card Company Limited (referred to as "we", "us" or "our" in this privacy policy).</p>
            <p>More information about us can be found on the 'About Us' page.</p>
            <ol start="2">
            <li><strong>The information we collect</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>We collect certain basic information about you when you order products from our website. We recognise the importance of both keeping your information secure and of letting you know what we intend to do with it. We may amend our policy to reflect changes to our business, website, data protection law or other relevant legislation. We therefore ask you to revisit this page on a regular basis to ensure you are familiar with its terms. The policy sets out (1) who we are, and describes (2) the information we collect, (3) what we do with it and (4), how you can find out more.</p>
            <p>We collect information on you from this website:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>when you complete an on-line form or order</li>
            <li>when you pay for the products that we provide</li>
            <li>when you give us additional details about yourself in your online Account</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are a supplier to us, we may also retain information about you.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Online forms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In general, we will collect the information we need to provide you with the service to which the form relates. For example, if you place an order, we will collect your name and address, your telephone number, and your email address, and any other information which is required to process the product or service you are purchasing. Please note that we do not collect any special categories of personal data about you. This includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data.</p>
            <p>Where we ask for more information to help us improve our services, over and above the basic information required, your response is voluntary and you are free to not provide us with more information if you would prefer not to do so.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Indirect collection of your information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sometimes we collect personal information indirectly. This may be for HR reasons - for example, if you are related to a member of our staff and that person lists you as next of kin or gives us your details for staff administration purposes.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Supplier information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are one of our suppliers, we will use information we hold on you to manage the contract between us and to improve services to our customers. The information we hold may include information about your performance in providing products to us or to our customers.</p>
            <ol start="3">
            <li><strong>WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION</strong></li>
            <ul>
            <li>How we use it</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ol>
            <p>We use your information to provide you with the products and services that you request from us, and, if you have opted-in to receive emails from us with promotional offers or information, to offer you products and services that we consider appropriate for you in the future.</p>
            <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we originally collected it. If we need to use your personal data for a different purpose, we will contact you and set out the legal basis upon which we process your personal data.</p>
            <p>Usually, we will process your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>to fulfil our contractual obligations to you (such as processing your order);</li>
            <li>where you have provided your consent; or</li>
            <li>where it is in our (or a third party's) legitimate interests, e.g. where we have business or commercial reasons to use your personal data, unless such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights or freedoms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not sell, trade or rent your information to third parties. Any information received regarding the payment for any product or service will be used to process that payment. If you opt-in and choose to receive emails from us which relate to marketing information or promotional offers, the information (except any credit card details) will be kept on our marketing database and used by us to service your requirements if you place another order. Information on our marketing database is available to our marketing and administrative staff but may not be accessed by anyone else. If you do not opt-in to receive marketing information or promotional offers when you place your order, we will use the information you have given us to process your order efficiently, but we will not contact you regarding any other matter which does not directly relate to the processing and fulfilment of your order (although we will keep very limited information about you to ensure that we do not send you any marketing emails).</p>
            <p>We will keep you on our mailing list until you ask us not to contact you further. See 'finding out more' below for details of how to opt-out of mailings from us. Please note that we use a third party system (Mailchimp) to send out our marketing emails.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>When we share it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may disclose your information to third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Suppliers who process information on our behalf, such as our IT service providers. They will have incidental access to your information but will be obliged to act only on our instructions and to keep your information secure.</li>
            <li>Independent suppliers, who may handle your information as our client in the course of processing one of our orders, and are required to respect and preserve the confidentiality of personal information.</li>
            <li>We may disclose your information to law enforcement or regulatory bodies if required to do so by them and to our auditors.</li>
            <li>We may also disclose your information to a third party in the context of actual or threatened legal proceedings or if otherwise required to do so by law, including to prevent fraud or to protect our rights, property, or safety of our customers, suppliers or employees.</li>
            <li>In the event that we sell our business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective buyer of such business or assets, or if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
            <li>With analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimization of our website.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If your personal data is provided to any third parties, you are entitled to request details of the recipients of your personal data or the categories of recipients of your personal data.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>How we keep it secure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will keep your information secure by taking appropriate technical and organisational measures against its unauthorised or unlawful processing and against its accidental loss, destruction or damage. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website (including payment card details); any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
            <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach, and we will notify you and any applicable supervisory authority of a breach where we are legally required to do so. We will notify the Information Commissioners Office as soon as possible, and where possible, within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach, unless we consider that the personal data breach is not notifiable.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><u>Data retention </u></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
            <p>In the event that you do not use your online account or submit an order on our website for a period of five years, then we will treat your account as expired and your personal data will be deleted.</p>
            <p>If you have consented to receiving marketing information from us, we will continue to send you the marketing information you have consented to, unless you opt-out at any time. Our marketing emails will always contain an opt-out link which you can click on. Alternatively, you can ask us to stop sending you marketing material at any time by writing to us, by calling us on the telephone or by writing to us at our postal address. All of these details are in the <a href="{{ route ('contact-us') }}">Contact Us</a> section.</p>
            <p>We will always include an unsubscribe email address when we send you marketing information or promotional offers by email.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In certain circumstances we may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, so that we can use this for business planning and other business uses which are in our legitimate interests. When we do this we may use such anonymised information without further notice to you.</p>
            <ol start="4">
            <li><strong>Finding out more</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>In certain circumstances, you have the following legal rights in relation to your personal data:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>To request access to your personal data that we hold (please see further below);</li>
            <li>To request correction of the personal data we hold about you if it is incorrect, out of date or incomplete. Please inform us about changes to your details so that we can keep our records accurate and up to date;</li>
            <li>To request erasure of your personal data;</li>
            <li>To object to processing of your personal data (please see further below);</li>
            <li>To request the processing of your personal data be restricted;</li>
            <li>To request the transfer of your personal data so that it can be transferred to you or a third party that you have chosen; and</li>
            <li>To request we discontinue any consent-based processing of your personal data after you withdraw that consent. This will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain things to you (such as details about new offers or products) and/or your online Account may not work as effectively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>You have the right to object, at any time, to the processing of your personal data which is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, including where we undertake any form of automated processing of your personal data, consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to you, such as analysing or predicting your personal preferences (this is sometimes referred to as 'profiling'). If you object to the processing, we must no longer process that personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or that the processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>You also have the right, at any time, to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. </strong></p>
            <p>If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please contact us. Please note that we may not be required to comply with your request. If this is the case, we will notify you.</p>
